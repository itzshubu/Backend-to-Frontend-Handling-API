### Install Dependencies
- **Scalable architecture**: The project likely has separate dependencies for the backend and frontend. Navigate to each directory and install the necessary dependencies

For the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
For the backend:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
### Start-the-backend-project
Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:For the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
#### The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified)

### Start-the-Frontend-Application
Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the application:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm start
```
By following these steps, you should be able to get both the backend and frontend up and running locally. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check that all environment variables are correctly set and that both servers are running without errors.
